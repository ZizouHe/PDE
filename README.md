This is a little memorable repository to cover the class materials in partial differential equations course, Spring 2018. It was held by [Prof. Huaiyu Jian](http://faculty.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/~hjian/), Department of Mathematics, Tsinghua University.

1. **Notes** contains the class notes. Most of the class notes have been coded into *PDE Notes.pdf* while a small fraction are still in the hand-written form.

2. **Materials** covers the sample exams and solution manuals.
